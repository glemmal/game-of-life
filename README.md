# Game of life

Play god and create small pixel squares that develop a life on their own.
This game is following the rules of Conway's Game of life:

- If a dead cell has exactly three living neighbours it get's born.
- If a living cell has less then two living cell neighbours the cell dies.
- If a living cell is surounded by three living cells it's kept alive.
- If a living cell is surounded by more than three cells it dies.

It's very basic at the moment and it is currently not exactly behaving like it should (compared to other 'game of lifes'). Feel free to contribute :)
